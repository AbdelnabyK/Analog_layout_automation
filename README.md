# Analog Layout Automation

## Overview
This project focuses on the automation of analog layout design, specifically targeting the enhancement of an existing tool and the creation of a comprehensive layout automation framework capable of handling all stages of the layout process. The primary objective is to streamline the process of designing analog circuits by automating layout generation, optimization, and verification.

## Project Highlights
- **Back-End Flow Automation:**
  - Automated the back-end flow by extracting design parameters and optimizing Place and Route (PnR) for generating fully functional GDSII files.

- **OTA Circuit Layout Enhancement:**
  - Enhanced the layout of Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) circuits by customizing the Differential pair (Diff Pair) topology and floor-planning multiples of rows to meet matching and signal constraints.

- **Script Development:**
  - Developed scripts to parse any OTA circuit output, facilitating the generation of fully functional layouts with minimized area, passing Design Rule Checking (DRC) and Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) in a matter of seconds, significantly reducing the manual effort required.

## Objectives
The main objective of this graduation project is to develop an automation tool capable of handling all stages of analog layout design, including pattern recognition, placement pattern generation, auto-routing of parameterized cells (PCs), global routing, and verification checks such as DRC and LVS.

## Methodology
The automation tool will focus on testing the Recycle Folded Operational Transconductance Amplifier (RFOTA), a fundamental analog circuit application, using Python scripting for pattern recognition, optimization, and placement pattern generation, along with a Skill scripting component for PC routing, global routing, and verification.

## Quality Standards
To ensure adherence to industry standards, the ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 standard for software lifecycle processes will be followed throughout the development process, from software acquisition to the design of the Graphic User Interface (GUI). The highest standards will be maintained to ensure the quality and reliability of the automation tool.

## Conclusion
Automating analog layout design is crucial in the field of integrated circuit design, especially with the increasing complexity of IC designs and the demand for faster turnaround times. Automated layout tools optimize layout parameters, improve circuit performance, and enhance manufacturing yield. Despite challenges, ongoing research and development efforts continue to advance automated analog layout design, offering more efficient and effective tools for designing high-performance analog circuits.
